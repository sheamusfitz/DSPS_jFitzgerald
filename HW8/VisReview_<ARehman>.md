## Review of the Plot:

### Points of improvement

1- The plot is somewhat ambiguous, especially for a person who has little knowledge about the Pokemon game. for example what does
HP, PU or ZU stands for?

2- I think you have not chosen the colors yourself rather you have let python choose the colors, It is hard to distinguish between
the two black colors (representing Ubers and OVerUsed in the legend) also the yellow color is almost invisible on my white screen.

3- The axis labels are bit hard to read (or maybe its just my small laptop screen).

### Quality of The Plot:

All the information is nicely presented in one single graphics which would otherwise take saveral plots to be conveyed properly.
