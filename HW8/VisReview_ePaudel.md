Following are my recommendations on the visualization:
1) The axes labels are small and hard to read. They could have larger font size. Label HP looks like an abbreviation hard to understand. PU and ZU in the legends also cannot be understood. Actual name for those abbreviations would be better. These would improve clarity in the plot.
2) The axes have no units associated with them. So,it is hard to get sense of what the numbers meant.
3) The colour used for scatterplot is overwhelming. Also, the yellow colour used for ZU is hard to see. Better color selection would help to understand the plot better and improve its aesthetics.


Good feature of the visualization is that it uses two dimensional corner plot to show relations between pairs of various game features and uses color to show third feature of how well they are used instead of using a three dimensional plot which could have been hard to read. The plot is honest on what it wants to display.
